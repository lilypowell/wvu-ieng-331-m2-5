# Design Rationale

## Parameter Flow

Trace how a command-line argument (e.g., `--seller-state SP`) travels through your code:
which function parses it, how it reaches the queries module, and how it changes the SQL that runs.
Include the actual function names and parameter names from your code.

## SQL Parameterization

Pick one of your `.sql` files and explain:
- What the raw SQL looks like (with `$1`, `$2` placeholders)
- How `queries.py` reads the file and passes Python values as parameters
- Why parameterized queries are used instead of f-strings
- Why SQL lives in `.sql` files rather than inline in Python

## Validation Logic

For each validation check in `validation.py`, explain:
- What it checks and why that check matters
- What happens if it fails (halt vs. warning)
- How you chose your thresholds (e.g., why 1,000 rows as a minimum)

## Error Handling

Pick 2 specific `try/except` blocks in your code and explain:
- What exception you catch and why that specific type
- What the code does when the exception is raised
- What would happen to the user if you used a bare `except:` instead

## Scaling & Adaptation

Answer both:
1. If the Olist dataset grew to 10 million orders, what part of your pipeline would break or slow down first? What would you change?
2. If you needed to add a third output format (e.g., a JSON API response), where in your code would you add it and what functions would you modify?
